# Overview
The assignment involves working with value function approximation algorithms, exploring OpenAI Gym environments, and using a project-management tool. It includes implementing Deep Q-learning (DQN) based on DeepMind's paper and improving the DQN algorithm. The goal is to understand approximation methods, deep neural networks, and techniques for stabilizing training and improving performance.
